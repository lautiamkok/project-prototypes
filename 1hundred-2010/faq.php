				<h4>Who's my package arriving with?</h4>

				<p>All products will be posted to mainland UK customers using Royal Mail signed for services. International orders will be dispatched using Royal Mails Airsure service. </p>



				<h4>Who's my package arriving with?</h4>

				<p>Annoyingly, some people may be charged a fee by their customs authorities for handling your goods. We cannot control the amount these different governments charge.</p>


				<h4>How have you protected my order?</h4>

				<h4>How have you protected my order?</h4>

				<p>We love packaging! We also believe that the minute you come into contact with your purchase(s) you should be wowed and intrigued by the whole experience. We put careful consideration into making sure your parcels stay in the condition we send them out in. Art prints ar wrapped in Acid free tissue paper and sealed in heavy card tubes with lots of padding. T-shirts are packaged with numerous layers of protection. First the T-shirt is wrapped in acid free tissue paper, then sealed in a cardboard box. Finally its wrapped in craft paper, labeled and wrapped in twine. See our blog for photos of our packaging techniques.</p>

				<h4>Is this site safe?</h4>

				<p>This website uses Shopify. Shopify is a leading e-commerce hosted application that allows us to set up an online store to sell our goods.

				<p>We have a standard delivery time in the UK of 2 to 6 days for all our products. In the unlikely event there is a delay we will notify you within 24 hours of making the order. </p>

				<p>International orders are difficult to guarantee in a certain time frame due to customs. We will despatch your order within 2 to 6 working days. Our mail service will deliver to European destinations within three working days and worldwide within five. If you haven't received your order between 8 to 28 days of receiving your shipping confirmation then there may be a problem. We suggest contacting either your local post office or customs to see if your package is being retained. Then contact us if still undelievered.</p>

				<h4>What do you do with my contact information</h4>

None, and we mean none of this information will ever be given to third parties.
